# MamboDronePrecisionLanding

This project is an attempt the get a parrot Mambo FPV minidrone to autonomously land on a target.

# Notes for improvements
- Proper Logging
- experiment to try and find out when the image was taken (how old is it by the time it's downloaded)
- try to use the accelerometer data do determine how the vehicle has moved since the last image
- try proper PID control for commanding guiding the vehicle to the target
- mirror on FPV camera to look down but actually get a decent frame rate
